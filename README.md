# Labyrinth+
Quality of life mod for the level Labyrinth which saves permanent progress across sessions, and adds bonus content.

Progress is saved between each attempt and also on level exit.

This mod only does anything in the level "Labyrinth" uploaded by tricipital, which releases on September 27, 2025.

I'm aware this code looks repetitive and I would refactor it but since I'm not aware of any actual unit testing tools for Geode, I can't easily test to ensure the refactored code works as intended.
